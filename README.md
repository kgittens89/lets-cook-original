## Project Description 
> My app is called Let’s Cook! It’s a recipe app for people who have trouble deciding on what to cook for the day. Users are initially presented with 3 random recipe choices, which lead to the recipe details. Users can also click for a random recipe choice. In the future, I’d like to sort recipes by diet preferences, course, etc.
